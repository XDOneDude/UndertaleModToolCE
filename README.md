# UndertaleModTool Community Edition

A fork of [UndertaleModTool](https://github.com/UnderminersTeam/UndertaleModTool) with a lot of features for Pizza Tower modding and stuff.

## Features

As more and more features get merged into vanilla UTMT (which is a good thing!), and due to Underanalyzer, UTMTCE's unique featureset keeps getting smaller and smaller. However, there are still a few things left:

- Deletion buttons for some inner asset types (like object actions)
- Automatic `.win.po` file associations for files generated by Pizza Oven
- A few additional scripts, in the UTMTCE Scripts folder
- Probably not more to come in the future.

## Download

There are a few ways to get UTMTCE:
- 1: Download the current release build from [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/tools/14193/)
- 2: In v0.5.5 and above, go to Settings -> Update app to latest commit to update to the latest GitHub commit.
- 3: Get a nightly build from [Github Actions artifacts](https://github.com/XDOneDude/UndertaleModToolCE/actions/) (requires a GitHub account)
- 4: Compile it yourself; the steps are [the same as in vanilla UTMT](https://github.com/krzys-h/UndertaleModTool#compilation-instructions)
